**Material**: 

 * **Relay (5v)**
 * **LED light (5v)**
 * **Wires**



#### Step 1: connect resistor to RPi as shown below:

The power wires from RPi will supply power to both relay and LED light.


#### Step 2:  Start RPi, then open Python console  and paste the following code:

~~~

import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO   
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

GPIO.setup(4, GPIO.OUT)

for i in range(100):
	GPIO.output(4, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(1)
	GPIO.output(4, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)
~~~


It supposed to see the LED light blink every second.
